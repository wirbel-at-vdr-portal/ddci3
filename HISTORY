VDR Plugin 'ddci3' Revision History
----------------------------------

INITIAL VERSION:
================================================================================
- fork from Jasmin Jessich's wonderful ddci2 Plugin. Thank you, Jasmin!
  For details, please visit   https://github.com/jasmin-j/vdr-plugin-ddci2

- If ddci2 works smoothly for you, pls stick to original authors source!
  Only users where ddci2 stucks on VDR startup should spend more time.

- bug hunting: why the heck does the Digital Devices CI adapter doesn't startup
  correctly on nearly half of VDR starts?? *this* is the only reason for this
  fork. Goal of this fork:
  1. fix CI startup.
  2. if 1. is not possible, restart VDR process automatically if CI doesnt
     respond.


2021.01.07_09h22:
================================================================================

- refactor everything to understand Jasmin Jessich's Plugin. As it's working
  with different threads, thats quite difficult, therefore..
  * keep license as the original authors choice! GPL v2
  * Any class and it's name has changed. Give it names that i can understand.
  * Filenames have changed. Give it names that i can remember.
  * remove macros as much as possible. force users to use new VDR Versions
    with MTD support. No need for old VDR versions anymore.
    Simplify code reading for this plugin.
  * refactor plugins logging facility - keeping it simpler.
  * restart README, HISTORY files, as many thing have changed. :(


- refactor main plugin class, split into Initialisation() and Start(),
  also refactor DD CI device search

- new file: as part of device search, FileList.h taken from my easyvdr VDR
  Plugin (same license, GPL v2) was added.

- force VDR process to die, if CI/CAM in unaccessible and dead state.
  -> if so, the kernel driver stopped working completely. Any further write
     access to device is answered badly.
  -> this requires YOU as user, to restart the VDR process as soon as possible,
     it it dies at all. Unfortunally, there's now other way to recover the
     functionality of the CI/CAM
  -> if VDR dies and restarts by runvdr or similar, no longer recordings are
     missing and encrypted channels for live tv or recordings are just working
     fine.

- i put all the original sources 1:1 into new folder 'ddci2' as reference for
  you. You may try to compare to my refactored code, if neccessary. This also
  enshures, that the originals authors code is saved in a second place. You may
  also want to read the originals authors README and HISTORY files.

- different commandline options as ddci2. I needed it for debugging.
  - new option:       --debug-buffers    debug RingBuffer sizes
  - new option:       -L, --local        log to /var/log/ddci3.log instead of syslog
  - removed option:   -d  --debugmask    Bitmask to enable special debug logging


2021.01.23:
================================================================================
- Plugin works for me like a charm, time to share.

- rework copyright hints

- no further changes.

- increase version, as files have new dates.

- as the plugin now *seriously* changed, i release it under a different name,
  because it *will* behave differently on startup and don't want to screw up
  anything. It shows *different* debug messages, not comparable to original
  source. And i don't want the original author to be bothered with changes i
  did..
